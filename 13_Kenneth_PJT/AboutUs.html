Don't think of us as a realtor, think of us as your friend.<br>A smarmy friend who puts their picture on evrything like it's a highschool yearbook and demands a precentage of your money to tell you things you<br>already know, like "this is a bathroom" or "This garden would be great for your Kids to play in" or "You won't fit in around here. You're black."</strong></p><p align="center"><strong>Call Dynasty 7 today, and say hello to a good buy.</strong></p><p align="center"><img src="Images/75622-16310541743518-800.png" width="800" height="500" alt=""/></p>
