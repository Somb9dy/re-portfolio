</h2><h3>$762,000</h3><p>[Redacted] is a place where property values can only go up and high magnitude earthquakes never happen, so where better to balance a luxury apartment on stilts over a steep hillside in a crowded residential area? The first time you feel yourself and everything you own sway in a light breeze you'll be surprised how good this sounded on paper.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><img src="Images/Dynasty8-GTAV-HighEnd-2045NorthConkerAvenue.png" alt="" width="650" height="" class="right"/><h2>2045 North Conker Avenue</h2><h3>$727,000</h3><p>Designed and constructed in direct violation of every building law in the state, this luxury apartment is a testament to the power of a can-do attitude and utter disregard for standards of health, safety and common sense. Time to pour yourself a drink, forget about the forty foot drop, and congratulate yourself on keeping that pioneer spirit alive.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><img src="Images/Dynasty8-GTAV-HighEnd-2113MadWayneThunderDrive.png" alt="" width="650" height="" class="left"/><h2>2868 Hillcrest Avenue</h2><h3>$672,000</h3><p>The previous owner of this gorgeous cliffside manor died doing a yoga pose on the rear balcony railing... but at least they got the Snapmatic shot. It's a tough act to follow, but if you're rich and stupid enough to buy into this neighbourhood you're already most of the way there. Just follow your fragile heart.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><img src="Images/Dynasty8-GTAV-HighEnd-2862HillcrestAvenue.png" alt="" width="650" height="" class="right"/><h2>2862 Hillcrest Avenue</h2><h3>$705,000</h3><p>Clinging to the side of the Vinewood hills like a dying oil tycoon clutching his carer-turned-sixth-wife, this three story mansion more than enough compensates for deep structural flaws with sumptuous interior design. Open plan kitchen, minimalist furnishings, ever-present vertigo: this one really has it all.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><img src="Images/75622-16310541743518-800.png" alt="" width="650" height="322" class="left"/><h2>409 Riverside Manor</h2><h3>$907,000</h3><p>Live in the clouds while your bank balance hits the floor. An apartment so conspicuously expansive all your friends will immediately know how much you paid for it. The Downtown lateral living experience for people who secretly want to be LC based. Includes a 10-car garage.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><img src="Images/Dynasty8-GTAV-HighEnd-2866HillcrestAvenue.png" alt="" width="650" height="" class="right"/><h2>2866 Hillcrest Avenue</h2><h3>$525,000</h3><p>Skyscraper views and lateral living are last year's kind of vanity project. Put a more contemporary spin on your raging superiority complex by forcing your butler to wheeze up and down all three stores of this hillside palace, while you take selfies with the spectacular views of thousands of more comfortable, less expensive places to live behind you.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><img src="Images/Dynasty8-GTAV-HighEnd-3655WildOatsDrive_1.png" alt="" width="650" height="" class="left"/><h2>3655 Wild Oats Drive</h2><h3>$800,000</h3><p>Welcome to the heights of the Vinewood Hills, where the average first time buyer is 24 and the web 2.0 entrepreneurs are only outnumbered by the swarms of fading teenage pop sensations. Buy in now while the price is still ridiculously high - what are you, sensible?</p>
